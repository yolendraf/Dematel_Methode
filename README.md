Pemilihan SunScreen
Sunscreen selection based on facial skin type using Dematel and Waspas methods.

Introduction
This program facilitates the process of choosing a suitable sunscreen based on individual preferences and skin types. It employs the Dematel (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) and Waspas (Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment) methods to evaluate and rank sunscreen alternatives.

Features
Criteria Consideration: The program considers various criteria such as SPF, price, skin condition, content volume, finishing, formula, protection level (PA), texture, packaging, and fragrance.
Normalization: The cost and benefit criteria are normalized separately to ensure a fair evaluation.
Weighted Assessment: The system assigns weights to each criterion based on their importance.
Ranking: The alternatives are ranked using the calculated Weighted Aggregated Sum Product (WASPAS) values.
